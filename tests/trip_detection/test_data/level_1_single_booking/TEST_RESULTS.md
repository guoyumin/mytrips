# Level 1 Single Booking Test Results

## Test Summary
- **Test Case**: Single round-trip flight booking (Zurich → Paris → Zurich)
- **Test Date**: 2025-07-09
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passed

## Test Results by Model

### All Model Combinations Tested
1. **gemini-fast**: ✅ PASSED
2. **gemini-powerful**: ✅ PASSED  
3. **openai-fast**: ✅ PASSED
4. **openai-powerful**: ✅ PASSED
5. **claude-fast**: ✅ PASSED
6. **claude-powerful**: ✅ PASSED

### Key Findings
- All models correctly identified the trip boundaries (ZUR → CDG → ZUR)
- All models extracted the correct dates (2024-12-15 to 2024-12-18)
- All models identified Paris as the destination
- All models correctly parsed 2 transport segments
- Cost calculations varied slightly between models but all were reasonable

### Model Consistency
The comparison test verified that all 6 model combinations produced consistent core results:
- Same destination (Paris)
- Same start/end dates
- Same number of transport segments
- Consistent cities visited sequence

## Technical Notes
- Fixed JSON parsing issue by enforcing strict JSON-only output in prompts
- All AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude) are fully compatible
- Both fast and powerful model tiers produce reliable results for simple bookings

## Next Steps
This successful Level 1 test establishes a solid foundation for more complex test scenarios:
- Level 2: Multi-booking combinations (flight + hotel)
- Level 3: Existing trip updates
- Level 4: Complex booking relationships
- Level 5: Edge cases and error handling
